# React Code Challenge

The goal of this code challenge is to convert the class based component `OldProjectList.js` to a function based component `ProjectList.tsx`. There is no server for this code challenge, only front end code.

To get started:

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Task List

The only file you will need to modify for these two tasks is the `ProjectList.tsx` file. The first two tasks are intended to take 30 - 90 minutes total to complete. Please do not spend more than 2 hours on this.

- [x] Convert to function component with hooks
- [x] Use redux instead of local state for the project list (editing project can remain in state)

> NOTE: There should not be any linter errors when you are complete. Please commit after each step.

### Stretch Goals

These may require you to edit additional files.

- [x] Ability to clear the project list
- [x] Only display active projects **Don't think this was done super well, but with more time I could make it better.
- [ ] Ability to mark a project as inactive
